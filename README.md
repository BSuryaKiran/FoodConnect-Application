## 🔧 Configuration

### Vite Configuration
The project uses Vite for fast development and optimized builds. Configuration is in `vite.config.js`.

### Environment Variables
To add environment variables, create a `.env` file and prefix variables with `VITE_`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=your_api_url
```

Access in code:
```javascript
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Stuck on Dashboard Instead of Login
**Solution:** Clear localStorage
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
localStorage.clear()
// Then refresh the page
```

Or visit: `http://localhost:3000/clear-storage.html`

### Issue: Port Already in Use
**Solution:** Change port in `vite.config.js`
```javascript
server: {
  port: 3001
}
```

### Issue: Module Not Found
**Solution:** Ensure all imports use `.jsx` extensions
```javascript
import Login from './components/Login.jsx';
```
